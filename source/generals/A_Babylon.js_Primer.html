<h2><a name="babylonjs-webgl-game-creation-system" class="anchor" href="#babylonjs-webgl-game-creation-system"></a>Babylon.js WebGL Game Creation System!</h2><p>Hi! Welcome to The Babylon.js Primer, an introduction to some of the things you will need to know in order to get the most out of this useful Javascript-based WebGL framework.
What is a framework, you ask?&nbsp; You can think of a framework as scaffolding for a building, allowing you to build around it without worrying about the foundation. It makes a complicated system, (WebGL,) much easier to use.</p>
<p>We hope to teach you a large amount of information in a very quick manner.&nbsp; Often there are more ways than one to accomplish a task here.&nbsp; I will let you discover those other ways by yourself.&nbsp; For now we will teach you the quickest and easiest ways, determined by studying the traits of other new users of Babylon.js.</p>
<h2><a name="the-browser" class="anchor" href="#the-browser"></a>The Browser</h2><p>Simply put, you will need to use a browser that supports WebGL and has Javascript activated.&nbsp; Internet Explorer 11+, Firefox 4+, Google Chrome 9+, Opera 12+, etc.&nbsp; WebGL is also supported by many browsers for mobile devices.&nbsp; I will let you investigate the details of mobile WebGL, but know that Babylon.js has many features designed with mobile WebGL in mind.&nbsp; Additionally, Babylon.js has complete support for full-immersion stereoscopic viewing and virtual reality head gear!</p>

<h2><a name="scene-file-layout" class="anchor" href="#scene-file-layout"></a>Scene File Layout</h2><p>Although we have another tutorial that covers basic scenes, I would like you to now EXAMINE a basic Babylon.js scene file.&nbsp; So here we go:</p>
<p><img src="http://urbanproductions.com/wingy/babylon/misc/codepic04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>That is a BIG picture, isn&#39;t it?&nbsp; This is a complete Babylon.js scene, using the &#39;single HTML file&#39; method.&nbsp; This is not the only (or best) method of setting up a scene, but it is fast and easy.&nbsp; I have colored important sections of &#39;the big picture&#39; and we will now examine each section individually.</p>
<h3><a name="the-external-includes-red-section" class="anchor" href="#the-external-includes-red-section"></a>The External Includes - Red Section</h3><p>&#39;Includes&#39; is not necessarily the best term to describe the red section of the big picture, but I will be using that term often in this tutorial.&nbsp; Three external Javascript files are being included into this scene.</p>
<p>The first external include is hand.minified-1.2.js (often simply called hand.js) - a small Javascript framework that assists the Babylon.js cameras.</p>
<p>The next is cannon.js - an optional physics &#39;engine&#39; that allows WebGL shapes (meshes) to act like real life objects.</p>
<p>After that comes oimo.js - a different physics &#39;engine&#39; that performs a similar function to cannon.js, but is generally faster although it lacks some of the more advanced features present in cannon.js.</p>
<p>Most important, though, is the Babylon.js framework, our pride and joy.</p>
<p>Each of these includes are JavaSCRIPT files, and so they are included-in by using HTML <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> elements/tags.&nbsp; The shown &#39;src&#39; (source location) of these files is at the Babylon.js web site folders, but later I will tell you how to put these files on your home hard drive if you wish, and include them from there.&nbsp; They load-in faster when they are &#39;local&#39;, but you will need to change the &#39;src&#39; URL once you have saved them locally.&nbsp; I will show you how to do that soon.</p>
<h3><a name="the-css-styles-blue-section" class="anchor" href="#the-css-styles-blue-section"></a>The CSS Styles - Blue Section</h3><p>&nbsp;Notice the blue section of the big picture.&nbsp; That is the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles used to present the scene&#39;s web page,&nbsp; and adjust its WebGL canvas to be centered and filled-out nicely in your browser.</p>
<p>Someday, you may want to &#39;externalize&#39; these styles by placing them in a separate file, possibly called styles.css.&nbsp; Then you could remove the blue section from this HTML file, and use a HTML LINK element/tag to include-in that separate CSS style document.&nbsp; I will not be telling you how to do that, but there are plenty of documents on the web that will show you how.&nbsp; It is very easy.</p>
<h3><a name="the-internal-include-green-section" class="anchor" href="#the-internal-include-green-section"></a>The Internal Include - Green Section</h3><p>Here is the fifth HTML SCRIPT element/tag in the big picture scene file.&nbsp; We used 4 SCRIPT elements/tags to do the external includes.&nbsp; This one is an INTERNAL include.&nbsp; Notice that it has no &#39;src&#39; URL.&nbsp; That is because it is a section of Javascript code that YOU have written directly into this document.&nbsp; Yes, YOU.&nbsp; Now you are a Javascript programmer!</p>
<p>You could &#39;externalize&#39; the entire green section, and possibly place it into a file called... &#39;myJavascript.js&#39;... maybe in a folder called &#39;jsfolder&#39;.&nbsp; Then you could remove the green section, and add one more EXTERNAL INCLUDE script element/tag that might look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;script src=&quot;./jsfolder/myJavascript.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You need not concern yourself with that, at this point.&nbsp; Externalizing your Javascript is often done when you have written LOTS of Javascript code.&nbsp; Externalizing your code into separate files helps your project be organized, but it is not necessary this early in your webGL adventures.</p>
<p>The JS code you see inside the green section... will be talked about soon.&nbsp; Mainly, I would like you to study the big picture, and see how the single HTML file method of creating Babylon.js scenes... is structured.&nbsp; I want you to try to visualize and somewhat memorize... this scene file&#39;s &#39;layout&#39;.</p>
<h3><a name="the-createscene-function-purple-section" class="anchor" href="#the-createscene-function-purple-section"></a>The createScene() Function - Purple Section</h3><p>The purple section of the big picture... is the createScene() &#39;function&#39;... a Javascript &#39;function&#39;.&nbsp; It is the most important section of a &#39;single HTML file&#39; Babylon.js scene.&nbsp; You are not required to use a createScene() function in your Javascript code, but please do... in these early days of your webGL learning.&nbsp; I have some magic to show you... which is available if you keep most of your scene code... inside a function called createScene().&nbsp; (Like the one shown in the big picture.)</p>
<p>Inside the createScene() function (the purple section)... we will be doing the actual Babylon.js commands and directives that cause beautiful webGL to happen.&nbsp; The rest of the big picture sections... are simply helpers and preparations... for the fantastic purple section... the createScene() function.&nbsp; Remember its name, because I will be mentioning it often in many Playpen Series tutorials.&nbsp; It will become your best friend.&nbsp; This I can promise.</p>
<h2><a name="a-visit-to-the-playground" class="anchor" href="#a-visit-to-the-playground"></a>A Visit to The Playground</h2><p>We have worked hard and learned much, so we deserve some playground time, at the Babylon.js Playground web site.&nbsp; Here is a scene that I once created and then saved... at the playground:</p>
<h2><a name="babylonjs-playground" class="anchor" href="#babylonjs-playground"></a>BabylonJS Playground</h2><p>You might want to open that playground scene in a new window or new tab, so you can switch back and forth between here and there.</p>
<p>See the &#39;createScene&#39; function in the left-side code editing window?&nbsp; Does it look familiar?&nbsp; It is the very same code from the purple section of the big picture (but with a couple of word-wrapped lines).&nbsp; Now you can see why the createScene function is an important section.&nbsp; It is somewhat portable.&nbsp; You can copy createScene functions to/from the playground editor, and to/from your home scene files.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s pretend that you have been working on a scene file at home, and after many tries, you just cannot get it to work properly.&nbsp; You could copy your home createScene function, then visit the playground, press its <strong>CLEAR</strong> button to empty its editor window, and then paste YOUR createScene function into the editor. Press the playground&#39;s <strong>RUN</strong> button and see if it works.&nbsp; If it does not work, you can do some changes in the editor window, and hit <strong>RUN</strong> again... and again, and again.&nbsp; Experiment with it there, and if you still cannot get it to work, you can press the <strong>SAVE</strong> button.&nbsp; When you do that, the playground will give your scene a unique URL.&nbsp; It will look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#QKQHS">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#QKQHS</a></p>
<p>Now you can bookmark that unique URL, and then visit the Babylon.js forum at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/16-babylonjs/">http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/16-babylonjs/</a></p>
<p>There, you can start a new topic, tell everyone the URL to your broken playground createScene function, and ask others if they will please visit your playground scene and help you get it working correctly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is called white-boarding.&nbsp; It is an easy way to allow many people to work on your createScene function and help you figure out what is wrong.&nbsp; See how the createScene function is &#39;portable&#39;?&nbsp; You took it from your home, to the playground, then played with it there for awhile.&nbsp; Then, if needed, you clicked the playground&#39;s <strong>SAVE</strong> button, which gave it a URL.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then you went to the forum and showed that URL to others, and asked for their help.&nbsp; Handy, huh?&nbsp; We think so.</p>
<h2><a name="more-about-the-playground" class="anchor" href="#more-about-the-playground"></a>More About The Playground</h2><p>Once again let&#39;s visit the saved playground scene that I sent you to, above.</p>
<p><a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#QKQHS">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#QKQHS</a></p>
<p>This time, I would like you to press the <strong>Get .zip</strong> button.&nbsp; The playground will open a small panel allowing you to download this scene.&nbsp; Save the zip file in some new empty folder on your home computer.&nbsp; Now use an UNZIP utility program to unzip it.&nbsp; Notice that there is one file in the folder, called index.html.&nbsp; Please load that file into a text editor or programming editor.&nbsp; Does it look like the big picture above?&nbsp; Sure it does.&nbsp; ANY scene from the Babylon.js playground, including its pre-installed demo scenes, can be brought to your home with the <strong>Get .zip</strong> button.&nbsp; Most of them will look very similar to the big picture, above.</p>
<p>There is a tutorial for the Babylon.js playground.&nbsp; Just <a href="http://doc.babylonjs.com/page.php?p=22631"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Wow, this is a lot of information, isn&#39;t it?&nbsp; You have learned what a scene file (the big picture) looks like, you have learned about its important createScene() function and how copy&#39;n&#39;paste portable it is.&nbsp; You have seen a createScene() function in the Babylon.js playground, and you have been introduced to the playground&#39;s RUN, SAVE, and Get .zip buttons.</p>
<p>You are becoming a Babylon.js TOOLS expert.&nbsp; When I say &#39;tools&#39;, I mean... you have learned the things that SUPPORT the createScene() function.&nbsp; Are you ready to engage in learning some things about the code that is used in a createScene() function?&nbsp; I knew you were.</p>
<h2><a name="diving-into-createscene" class="anchor" href="#diving-into-createscene"></a>Diving into createScene()</h2><p>&nbsp;
I would like you to visit the Babylon.js Playground once again (open in a new window or new tab, if possible), but this time we will visit its base URL at:</p>
<p><a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net</a></p>
<p>Notice the button that is currently labeled <strong>Basic Scene</strong>.&nbsp; (It is actually called the Scene Selector button, but it is currently LABELED &#39;Basic Scene&#39;)</p>
<p>Click on it, please.&nbsp; Notice that there is a wide variety of pre-installed scenes (createScene functions).&nbsp; Feel free to select any of them.&nbsp; Tour them, drag your pointer around on them, and even change the code in the editor and hit <strong>RUN</strong> again.&nbsp; You cannot damage the pre-installed scenes, even if you hit <strong>SAVE</strong>.&nbsp; You are safe in a playground of Babylon.js scenes, and you can see MANY createScene functions in action.&nbsp; You can play with their settings and hit Run again - fun.&nbsp; And again, you can use the <strong>Get .zip</strong> button on any of these playground demos, and take copies of them for your home collection.&nbsp; Handy, yes?</p>
<p>Now for the good stuff.&nbsp; Every createScene() (every scene)... in Babylon.js... generally REQUIRES three things.</p>
<p><strong>1. A Camera.</strong>&nbsp; The three most commonly used TYPES of cameras... are ArcRotateCamera, FreeCamera, and TouchCamera.&nbsp; There are many types of camera available in Babylon.js, but these three are the most common.&nbsp; ANY number of cameras can be coded into a scene, but only one of those cameras... is the &#39;active camera&#39;.&nbsp; We have a tutorial in our Playpen Series... dedicated to talking about cameras.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Light.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 4 basic types of lights available in Babylon.js.&nbsp; They are PointLight, SpotLight, DirectionalLight, and HemisphericLight.&nbsp; ANY number of lights can be coded into a scene,&nbsp; but only the first 4 lights in the scene&#39;s lights list... will be used by the scene.</p>
<p>To be honest, a light is not an absolute requirement.&nbsp; If the mesh in a scene... all have a material.emissiveColor or material.emissiveTexture properly set, then they will each produce their own light.&nbsp; They will be &#39;self-illuminated&#39;.&nbsp; Careful, it is easy to get lost in a scene without a light.&nbsp; Good advice would be to ALWAYS have one light (a HemisphericLight aimed to the sky, is a very handy wide-lighting tool).&nbsp; You can adjust its .intensity value to set its brightness.&nbsp; We have a tutorial in our Playpen Series... dedicated to talking about lights.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Shape.</strong>&nbsp; A shape is also called a <strong>mesh</strong>.&nbsp; Every scene needs something to be viewed, right?&nbsp; Cameras are invisible, and so are lights.&nbsp; Every scene needs a mesh, or many.&nbsp; There is no limit to the number of mesh in your scene.&nbsp; A mesh can be one of the many shapes that are built-in to Babylon.js, or it can be a shape that you plotted yourself using Babylon&#39;s VertexData system, or it can be a mesh that has been &#39;imported&#39; into the scene... from a modeling package such as Blender or 3D Studio Max.</p>
<p>You can learn many more things about Babylon.js scenes... in the other <a href="http://doc.babylonjs.com/">tutorials and documentation</a>.&nbsp; And don&#39;t forget to look at the &#39;createScene()&#39; functions of the playground&#39;s pre-installed demo scenes.&nbsp; The Babylon.js playground is a learning wonderland, and it is a whole lot of fun, too.</p>
<h2><a name="babylonjs-objects-properties-methods-and-values" class="anchor" href="#babylonjs-objects-properties-methods-and-values"></a>Babylon.js Objects, Properties, Methods, and Values</h2><p>You have seen some createScene functions, and you have noticed that much of the Javascript code used to make a Babylon.js scene... sets values on object properties.&nbsp; To illustrate what I mean:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">object.property = value;
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s talk more about these four things... objects, properties, methods, and values.</p>
<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
<p>First, do not think of objects as 3D shapes/mesh.&nbsp; Those ARE objects, but here, we are talking about...&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Javascript Objects</strong></p>
<p>Some of the common Javascript objects used in a Babylon.js scene... are named <strong>engine, scene, canvas, mesh, light, camera, Vector3, Color3, ActionManager, and Animation</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, each of the following code lines... creates a Javascript object (or more):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// Create a BABYLON.Engine type of object.
var engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true);

// Creates a BABYLON.Scene type of object.
var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);

// Creates a BABYLON.FreeCamera type of object
var camera = new BABYLON.FreeCamera(&quot;freecam&quot;, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 5), scene);

// Creates a BABYLON.DirectionalLight type of object
var light = new BABYLON.DirectionalLight(&quot;Dir0&quot;, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, -1, 0), scene);

// Creates a BABYLON.Mesh type of object
var mybox = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateBox(&quot;box&quot;, 6.0, scene);
</code></pre>
<p>You get the idea.&nbsp; Javascript objects, are used often in Babylon.js scenes.&nbsp; Sometimes you will create them, and other times you will get a &#39;reference&#39; or &#39;handle&#39; to an object that was created earlier.&nbsp; Getting a reference/handle to a Javascript object, essentially means opening a communication line to an already-built object.</p>
<p>Each of these Javascript objects have named &#39;pockets&#39; to store things-within.&nbsp; Often, values, data, and objects... get stored in those pockets.&nbsp; These value-storing pockets are called object &#39;properties&#39;.&nbsp; Properties are commonly &#39;set&#39; (putting a value INTO the pocket), and often &#39;get&#39; (looking into the pocket to see what&#39;s there).</p>
<p><strong>Properties</strong></p>
<p>Properties store values.&nbsp; These values are used by the Babylon.js framework... to &#39;render&#39; the scene.&nbsp; Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">light.intensity = 0.5;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we &#39;set&#39; the property named &#39;intensity&#39; on the object called &#39;light&#39; to a value of 0.5 (0.5 is called a FLOATING POINT value, or just &#39;a float&#39;).&nbsp; We&#39;ll talk about values, shortly.&nbsp; The main thing I want you to notice is that the property (pocket) had a NAME... .intensity, and we stored the value 0.5 into that pocket (on the object named &#39;light&#39;).</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>The other common type of &#39;pocket&#39; on a Javascript object... is called a &#39;method&#39; (sometimes called a &#39;function&#39;).&nbsp; Methods are used to store Javascript code onto Javascript objects.&nbsp; Earlier, I said that properties are &#39;set&#39;.&nbsp; Well, methods are &#39;called&#39;.&nbsp; Here is the way a method is &#39;called&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">scene.getMeshByName(&quot;box&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we have &#39;called&#39; the getMeshByName() method that is located on the object called &#39;scene&#39;.&nbsp; See that &quot;box&quot; thing inside the parentheses?&nbsp; That is called a &#39;parameter&#39; or sometimes called an &#39;argument&#39; or just... &#39;an arg&#39;.&nbsp; Some methods require one or more parameters inside the parentheses, and some require none at all.&nbsp; If you look at your createScene function (method) from the big picture above, it had empty parentheses.&nbsp; It did not require any parameters in order to be called.&nbsp; At other times, you might see createScene(engine).&nbsp; In this case, the createScene method DOES require a parameter...&nbsp; a Javascript ENGINE-type of object.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to teach everything about callable methods and settable properties on Javascript objects.&nbsp; The main thing is to try to take notice WHEN a &#39;pocket&#39; on an object... is a property, and when it is a method.&nbsp; Methods always use parentheses... sometimes empty, sometimes full of parameters/args.&nbsp; Properties never use parentheses and therefore never require parameters.</p>
<p>Sometimes, methods are used to SET values of properties, and sometimes methods are used to GET values of properties.&nbsp; These methods/functions are often called GETTERS and SETTERS.&nbsp; Notice the word &#39;get&#39; in the getMeshByName method above?&nbsp; It is a GETTER method.&nbsp; Here is a more proper use of that &#39;call&#39;:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var box_I_made = scene.getMeshByName(&quot;box&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This call is getting a reference/handle on a box that was made earlier in the code, and putting that reference into a variable called &#39;box_I_made&#39;.&nbsp; After you get that reference, you can do things to the box... like set property values.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">box_I_made.rotation.y = Math.PI/2;&amp;nbsp; // Rotate the box 90 degrees on the Y-axis.
</code></pre>
<p>It is difficult for me to explain, but actually quite easy to do, thanks to Babylon.js.&nbsp; Experimenting with properties and methods... is the fastest way to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Values</strong></p>
<p>Values... are often the things that are stored in an object&#39;s properties (&#39;pockets&#39;) and the things that are returned when GETTER methods are called.&nbsp; As crazy as this sounds, all values are Javascript objects.&nbsp; Remember that 0.5 float that we saw earlier?&nbsp; That is a Floating Point&nbsp; NUMBER OBJECT.&nbsp; The &#39;box_I_made&#39; variable above... it is a MESH OBJECT.&nbsp; The names of mesh, cameras, and lights... are STRING OBJECTS. Objects are everywhere, but they are good friends that help us stay organized.</p>
<p>There are two types of value objects that are very common in Babylon.js.&nbsp; They are the Vector3 value, and the Color3 value.&nbsp; Vector3 and Color3 values... deserve to have their own section in this giant tutorial.&nbsp; Here we go...</p>
<h2><a name="vector3-and-color3-values" class="anchor" href="#vector3-and-color3-values"></a>Vector3 and Color3 Values</h2><p>Two of the most-used values in Babylon.js, are Vector3 values and Color3 values.</p>
<h3><a name="vector3-values" class="anchor" href="#vector3-values"></a>Vector3 Values</h3><p>Vector3 values take the form of...</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">BABYLON.Vector3(xValue, yValue, zValue)
</code></pre>
<p>They are often used to set/store...</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of a .position property on mesh, light, or camera objects</li>
<li>the value of a .rotation property on a mesh object</li>
<li>the value of a .scaling property on a mesh object</li>
<li>the value of a .direction property on a light object</li>
</ul>
<p>The three &#39;parameters&#39; inside the parentheses of a Vector3 value... are floats.&nbsp; They can be negative or positive, and there is no practical limit to the size of those values.&nbsp; Let&#39;s look at a Vector3 being used to set the .position of a mesh.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">box.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 10, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>The xValue is 0, meaning that the box is positioned in the center of the x-axis.&nbsp; The yValue is 10, meaning that the box is positioned 10 units above the center of the y-axis.&nbsp; The zValue is 0, meaning that the box is positioned in the center of the z-axis.&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; We will talk more about positioning... further below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now let&#39;s look at a Vector3 being used to set a .rotation value:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">box.rotation = new BABYLON.Vector3(Math.PI/4, 0, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>Here, our box is being rotated around the x-axis... about 45 degrees.&nbsp; In Babylon.js, rotation is measured in radians.&nbsp; Math.PI/4 is approximately .707 radians.&nbsp; To rotate 90 degrees, it would be Math.PI/2, or about 1.57 radians.&nbsp; For 180 degrees, it would be Math.PI, or about 3.14 radians.&nbsp; To rotate 360 degrees, it would Math.PI times 2, or about 6.28 radians.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Vector3 values can be negative numbers as well.&nbsp; So you could easily use -Math.PI/4, -Math.PI/2, -Math.PI, and -Math.PI times 2.&nbsp; These values would rotate the object in the opposite direction around the x-axis.&nbsp; How about this Vector3 rotation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">box.rotation = new BABYLON.Vector3(Math.PI/2, 0, -.707);
</code></pre>
<p>If you think that it rotates our box in a positive (+) direction 90 degrees around the x-axis, AND ALSO rotates our box 45 degrees in a negative (-) direction around the z-axis, you would be correct.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Even though Vector3 values can contain very large negative or positive numbers, it is rarely necessary for any xValue, yValue, or zValue... to be outside the range of -6.28 to +6.28 <strong>for setting rotations</strong>.&nbsp; Any numbers outside that range would be unnecessary, because -6.28 (radians) rotates 360 degrees in one direction, and +6.28 (radians) rotates 360 degrees in the opposite direction.&nbsp; That&#39;s a full range of rotation, isn&#39;t it?&nbsp; We&#39;ll talk a bit more about rotation, further below.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s see a Vector3 used for scaling (stretching and shrinking) a mesh:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">box.scaling = new BABYLON.Vector3(1, 1, 3);
</code></pre>
<p>Scaling is a way to shrink or stretch a mesh along any of the 3 scene axes.&nbsp; In the above example, the xValue (1) indicates that no scaling change to the mesh along its x-axis... is desired.&nbsp; The yValue of 1 indicates that we want no change in scaling along the y-axis, either.&nbsp; The zValue of 3 indicates that we we are &#39;stretching&#39; our mesh along its z-axis... to 3 times its normal size.&nbsp; Easy, right?&nbsp; You bet!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I will talk more about scaling... further below.</p>
<p>Another use for a Vector3 value... is setting the .direction for certain types of lights:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">mySpotLight.direction = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, -1, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>Generally speaking, when a Vector3 value is used to set a DIRECTION, the xValue, yValue, and zValue are each in a range of negative 1... to positive 1.&nbsp; In the example above, our light is aimed negative on the y-axis... or... straight down.&nbsp; Directions (directional vectors) are used for more things than just lights, but lights is a common use.&nbsp; Directional vectors are not always easy things to determine the x, y, and z parameters/values for.&nbsp; We have some helpful tools on our lights... that will assist you in setting directions.&nbsp; You will learn about those tools in our lights tutorial.
&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="color3-values" class="anchor" href="#color3-values"></a>Color3 Values</h3><p>Color3 values look very much like Vector3 values.&nbsp; Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">BABYLON.Color3(rValue, gValue, bValue)
</code></pre>
<p>The rValue is for red, the gValue is for green, and the bValue is for blue.&nbsp; I bet you have already figured out that Color3 values are used for setting colors.&nbsp; The rValue, gValue, and bValue, all contain float numbers in the range of 0 to 1.&nbsp; Let&#39;s look at a few examples:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">BABYLON.Color3(1, 0, 0) - red
BABYLON.Color3(0, 1, 1) - cyan
BABYLON.Color3(0, 1, 0) - green
BABYLON.Color3(1, 0, 1) - violet
BABYLON.Color3(1, 1, 0) - yellow
BABYLON.Color3(0, 0, 0) - black
BABYLON.Color3(1, 1, 1) - white
BABYLON.Color3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) - medium gray
BABYLON.Color3(0.2, 0, 0.2) - dark purple
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;
Not so difficult.&nbsp; Let&#39;s say that you wanted to put a color on a box that you have already created.&nbsp; The first thing you do is create a Javascript object called a StandardMaterial.&nbsp; Then you would apply (set) that StandardMaterial as the box&#39;s .material property.&nbsp; This is covered by our Materials tutorial, but let&#39;s look at how that is done, here.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var myMaterial = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial(&quot;mymat&quot;, scene);
myBox.material = myMaterial;&amp;nbsp;
</code></pre>
<p>The first line creates a StandardMaterial and puts it into the variable named myMaterial.&nbsp; The second line sets the box&#39;s .material property... to be that newly-made StandardMaterial.&nbsp; The appearance of the box will not change yet, because we have not given the StandardMaterial any information about what color we want the box to be.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of the many properties on a StandardMaterial object... is named .diffuseColor.&nbsp; That property is the primary way to set a basic color.&nbsp; And right here... is where we use our new Color3 value.&nbsp; Let&#39;s have a look:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">myMaterial.diffuseColor = new BABYLON.Color3(0, 0.5, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>Our box is now colored medium green.&nbsp; It&#39;s just that easy.&nbsp; The StandardMaterial object has many other properties on it.&nbsp; You can add color to properties such as&nbsp; .specularColor, .emissiveColor, .ambientColor.&nbsp; All those properties are set (if you choose)... using our friend... the Babylon.js Color3 value.</p>
<p>Another use of the Color3 value is to set the .diffuse property of lights.&nbsp; Take careful note that the name of this property is .diffuse, and not .diffuseColor.&nbsp; Lights use a property named .diffuse to set their primary color.&nbsp; Let&#39;s take a look at how to set the primary color of a light that you have already created:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">myLight.diffuse = new BABYLON.Color3(0.5, 0, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>And there we go.&nbsp; We have colored the light beam that emits from our light... to be medium red.&nbsp; There is one more use for a Color3 value, and that is on one of our newest basic shape objects... called a LINES object.&nbsp; A LINES object does not use a StandardMaterial object for its color.&nbsp; It uses a property called .color.&nbsp; Here is an example of a LINES object being created, and then colored:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// Creation of a triangular lines mesh
var myLines = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateLines(&quot;itsName&quot;, [
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; new BABYLON.Vector3(-5, 0, 5),
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; new BABYLON.Vector3(5, 0, 5),
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, -5),
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; new BABYLON.Vector3(-5, 0, 5)
], scene);

// And here is how it is colored green...
myLines.color = new BABYLON.Color3(0,1,0);
</code></pre>
<p>The creation of the lines object was a bit strange, but it sure was easy to make it green, using a Color3 value.&nbsp; You will learn more about the lines mesh.... in our Basic Elements tutorial.&nbsp; For now, I just wanted to show you that it does not use a .diffuseColor property like a box with a StandardMaterial applied, nor a .diffuse property like we used for coloring light beams.&nbsp; It, instead, uses a property called .color.&nbsp; Simple.</p>
<h2><a name="my-new-friends-position-rotation-and-scalingnbsp" class="anchor" href="#my-new-friends-position-rotation-and-scalingnbsp"></a>My New Friends - .position, .rotation, and .scaling&nbsp;</h2><p>As you toured the Babylon.js Playground demo scenes, you surely saw some .position, .rotation, and maybe some .scaling properties being &#39;set&#39; with values.&nbsp; Let&#39;s take a look at each one:</p>
<p><strong>POSITION</strong> - Also called translation, every mesh is POSITIONED in a scene using X, Y, and Z settings.&nbsp; You can think of the .position property... as the mesh&#39;s LOCATION.&nbsp; The link below... is a saved playground scene that illustrates using a mesh&#39;s .position property.&nbsp; Try to open it in a new window or new tab, so you can jump back and forth between this tutorial... and the playground scene:</p>
<p><a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#35CPC">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#35CPC</a></p>
<p>In the yellow text at the top of the scene, you will see the Babylon.js one-line way to set mybox.position (using our friend... the Vector3 value object).</p>
<p>Below that, in green text, you will see 3 more lines of Babylon.js code.&nbsp; You see, you are NOT required to use a Vector3 to set a .position on a mesh.&nbsp; You can use the &#39;<strong>discrete</strong>&#39; way, instead.&nbsp; Loosely defined, &#39;discrete&#39; means... piece by piece... one step at a time.&nbsp; If you would like to set a mesh&#39;s .position values axis by axis, feel free to use the handy green &#39;discrete&#39; ways of doing it.</p>
<p>Watch this positioning demo scene for some time, if you please.&nbsp; It will not take long for you to completely understand mesh positioning.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>ROTATION</strong> - Every mesh is ROTATED in a scene... by setting the amount of spin around the shape&#39;s X, Y, and Z axes.&nbsp; Picture a box with a rod stuck through every side and coming out the opposite side.&nbsp; There are 6 sides to a box, so there would be 3 rods, an X rod, a Y rod, and a Z rod.&nbsp; Rotation is the amount (and direction) of spin... AROUND each of these invisible rods.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at a playground scene that I once created and saved.&nbsp; In this demo, I made those invisible rods... be visible:</p>
<p><a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#YIT1S">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#YIT1S</a></p>
<p>Take some time to carefully watch that scene.&nbsp; Like the last demo scene, the yellow text shows a Vector3 being used to set the .rotation property with some computer-generated values.&nbsp; The box is shown doing positive and negative rotations around each of the 3 axes.&nbsp; Under the yellow text... you again see the green text...&nbsp; showing the 3 &#39;discrete&#39; ways to set the box&#39;s .rotation property with values.&nbsp; I bet you understand this completely, don&#39;t you?&nbsp; Easy.</p>
<p><strong>SCALING</strong> - Scaling... is stretching or shrinking... along any of the 3 scene axes.&nbsp; Let&#39;s jump right into a saved playground scene that demonstrates scaling:</p>
<p><a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#1VMQNH">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#1VMQNH</a></p>
<p>Again, take some time to watch the scene.&nbsp; And once more, the yellow text shows the one-line Vector3 way of setting a mesh&#39;s .scaling, or you can use one or more of the discrete ways of setting scaling... shown in the green text. You may have noticed that scaling values are never negative.&nbsp; It would be illogical to use a negative scaling value, and if you decide to use some negative values, unexpected results may occur.</p>
<p>I would like you to take note... that scaling is <strong>for mesh only</strong>.&nbsp; For example, you can POSITION a mesh, camera, or light.&nbsp; You can often ROTATE a mesh, camera, or light.&nbsp; But SCALING... is for mesh.&nbsp; If you stretch or shrink (scale) a camera or light, you will break its electrical parts.&nbsp; (It&#39;s a joke, ok?)&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no reason to set scaling for a camera or light.&nbsp; They are invisible scene items.</p>
<h2><a name="quick-downloading-39the-big-439-externals" class="anchor" href="#quick-downloading-the-big-4-externals"></a>Quick Downloading &#39;The Big 4&#39; Externals</h2><p>Remember &#39;The Big Picture&#39; far above?&nbsp; In that section, I introduced you to &#39;The Big 4&#39; external include files...&nbsp; hand.js, cannon.js, oimo.js, and babylon.js.&nbsp; Many people use GitHub version-management systems to download those files from the Babylon.js GitHub source code repository.&nbsp; Some people make their own &#39;minified&#39; versions of Babylon.js... using the absolute latest source code files.&nbsp; Others like to be able to grab reasonably fresh versions of The Big 4... in simpler ways.</p>
<p>When you click Get .zip at the Babylon.js playground, you get a zip that contains a file called index.html.&nbsp; If you examine index.html in a text editor, you will see a file that looks very much like The Big Picture far above.&nbsp; Look at the external includes section... the first four HTML SCRIPT elements/tags.&nbsp; The .src attribute within each of those SCRIPT elements... point to URL&#39;s located at the Babylon.js web site.</p>
<p>If you want to make your home demo scenes run faster, you can download copies of the external includes... and put them into a folder.&nbsp; That folder should be located WITHIN the folder that holds your index.html.&nbsp; For example, in the same folder as index.html, you could create a folder called &#39;js&#39; (no quotes).&nbsp; Inside the js folder, you could put home copies of The Big 4 external include files.</p>
<p>Once you have that folder made, you can use the 4 links shown below... to get copies of The Big 4... and put each of them into your js folder.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/hand.minified-1.2.js"><strong>hand.js</strong></a>&nbsp; &lt;= right-click... save link/target</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/cannon.js"><strong>cannon.js</strong></a>&nbsp; &lt;= right-click... save link/target</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/oimo.js"><strong>oimo.js</strong></a>&nbsp; &lt;= right-click... save link/target</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/babylon.js"><strong>babylon.js</strong></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;= right-click... save link/target</p>
<p>Store each of those files into the new js folder.&nbsp; Also, you might want to copy them to some other folder as well, for using later.&nbsp; Try to remember to repeat these actions fairly often, maybe once per month, to ensure that you are always using a reasonably fresh version of The Big 4 files.&nbsp; Babylon.js is always evolving.&nbsp; New features are being added very quickly, and you want your home versions of The Big 4... to be fresh, so you can take advantage of those new features.</p>
<p>Once you have those external includes saved into your new js folder, you need to make some adjustments to the HTML.&nbsp; In your index.html file, you will need to change the .src attributes of all four external includes (the first four SCRIPT elements).&nbsp; Likely, you will want to make your SCRIPT elements look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;script src=&quot;./js/hand.minified-1.2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;script src=&quot;./js/cannon.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- optional --&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;script src=&quot;./js/oimo.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- optional --&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;script src=&quot;./js/babylon.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not using physics in your scene, you might want to remark-out (disable) the script elements that include-in cannon.js and oimo.js.&nbsp; To do that, you could do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;script src=&quot;./js/hand.minified-1.2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- &lt;script src=&quot;./js/cannon.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- &lt;script src=&quot;./js/oimo.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;script src=&quot;./js/babylon.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Easy.&nbsp; Most of these things you already know, don&#39;t you?&nbsp; I thought so.</p>
